## 1. MemberDB
**Purpose:** The identity core. One row per registered member. The authoritative source for all member profile data, cumulative stats, and the badge ID cache.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Primary key. Sequential integer suffix. Never reuse a deleted ID. |
| B | Email | `user@gmail.com` or comma-separated | Primary Gmail used for Google auth. Alternate Gmails comma-separated. Used by `getVerifiedMemberId()` for session resolution. |
| C | FullName | string | "Signature" name displayed under bio on profile. |
| D | DisplayName | string | Primary app handle/nickname. Shown everywhere in feeds. Must be unique, 2–30 chars. |
| E | JoinDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | Date member completed registration. Used for Anniversary badge calculation. |
| F | Country | string | User-provided location. Free text. |
| G | ShortBio | string | Personal introduction text. Shown on profile card. |
| H | LangSpoken | string | Languages with proficiency levels, comma-separated. e.g. `English (Native), Spanish (B1)` |
| I | LinkedIn | URL or blank | Full URL to LinkedIn profile. |
| J | Goodreads | URL or blank | Full URL to Goodreads profile. |
| K | FavGenre | string | Preferred book categories, comma-separated. Member-defined, not normalised. |
| L | ReadingGoal | string | Personal reading goal as free text. e.g. `Read 50 books this year` |
| M | LastAccessed | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | Timestamp of last app open. Written on every session load. Used by Anniversary badge gate (7-day activity check). |
| N | Celebration | JSON string or blank | Pending celebration payload written by MasterEngine. Shape: `{ "badges": ["ARKA_BADGE_X", …], "newLevel": "Level Name" }`. `badges` — IDs of badges earned since the member last dismissed the celebration card; MasterEngine appends, never overwrites. `newLevel` — most recent level the member advanced to; MasterEngine replaces on every level-up (only the latest matters). Blank = nothing pending. Cleared to `''` by `clearMemberCelebration()` when the member dismisses the card. Source of truth for badge data remains BadgeAwardDB — this column is a notification signal only. |
| O | Stats | JSON string | Nightly stats snapshot written by MasterEngine. Shape: `{ "allTime": { arkaPoints, pages, books, reviews, ratings, genres, libraryAdded, badges, ploggerWeeks, longestStreak }, "2026": { same keys }, "2025": { same keys }, … }`. The `allTime` key holds lifetime cumulative values recalculated from full source tables every nightly run. Each year key (e.g. `"2026"`) holds stats for that calendar year and is never modified once the year rolls over — old year keys accumulate as a permanent history. MasterEngine is the sole writer. The frontend reads this via `member.stats` (exposed by `getWave1Data()`). **Do not edit manually.** Legacy: prior to this format, Col O held a plain integer (TotalClubPoints). `_parseStatsJson_()` in MasterEngine handles the backward-compatible read for any pre-migration cells still holding integers. || P | TotalPages | integer | Lifetime cumulative pages read, summed from PageLogDB. Recalculated by MasterEngine. |
| Q | TotalBooks | integer | Lifetime count of unique Finished books from MemberShelfDB. Recalculated by MasterEngine. |
| R | ImageURL | Drive thumbnail URL | `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=FILE_ID&sz=w400` Google Drive thumbnail of member avatar. |
| S | CoachInsights | JSON string or blank | Computed insight payload. Shape: `{ tasks: [...], insights: {...}, aiAdvice: "...", statSnapshot: {...}, onboarding: { dismissed: bool, selfReported: string[], lastUpdated: string } }`. The `onboarding` sub-key is written by `saveOnboardingProgress()` and `markCoachTaskComplete()` when the member confirms self-reported tasks or dismisses the card. MasterEngine writes the full object on every nightly sync but preserves the existing `onboarding` sub-key. Blank for new members until the first nightly run. |
 
| T | ApprovalStatus | `Approved` / `Pending` / `Rejected` | Access gate. Enforced server-side in `getVerifiedMemberId()` and `initializeUser()` — only an exact `Approved` grants access; `Pending`/`Rejected`/blank are denied. New registrations start `Pending`. No grandfather rule: existing members must be set to `Approved` manually. Written by `setMemberApprovalStatus()` (admin) and seeded by `registerNewMember()`. |
| U | EmailOptOut | `TRUE` / blank | Email notification opt-out flag. `TRUE` = member has opted out and receives no Arka emails. Blank or `FALSE` = opted in (default for all members). Written by `updateEmailOptOut()` when the member flips the toggle in Edit Profile → Email Notifications. Read by MasterEngine's `_syncEmailQueue_()` — opted-out members are skipped when writing EmailQueueDB PENDING rows. Never written by MasterEngine. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Col A: Never reuse. Middle-row deletions break the `lastRow + 1` ID pattern — use `RepairMemberIDs.gs` after any deletion.
- Col D: Unique across all members. Enforced at registration and profile edit.
- Col O: MasterEngine is the single writer via `_parseStatsJson_()` + Stats JSON build. Manual edits will be overwritten on next sync. Do not store plain integers in this column after the first post-deployment nightly run.
- Cols P, Q: MasterEngine is the single writer. Retained for backward compatibility; can be retired in a future cleanup pass once all consumers read from Col O Stats JSON.- Col N: Written only by MasterEngine (`autoAwardBadge_()`) and cleared by `clearMemberCelebration()` when the member dismisses the card. Never write manually — the payload must be the canonical JSON shape `{ badges: string[], newLevel: string }`. Col N is a notification signal only; the source of truth for badge ownership is BadgeAwardDB.
- Col T: MasterEngine pads every row to 21 columns (`MEMBER_DB_TARGET_COL_COUNT = 21`) so full-row writes never go ragged or truncate this column.
- Col U: Never written by MasterEngine — member-controlled only via `updateEmailOptOut()`. MasterEngine reads it as a gate in `_syncEmailQueue_()` but never overwrites it.
---
 
## 2. PageLogDB
**Purpose:** Immutable reading session ledger. Every page-log action creates one row. Source of truth for streak calculation, PLogger metric, and total pages.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | LogID | `ARKA_PLOG_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | Timestamp | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the session was logged. Time stored in GAS script timezone (+0100). Frontend should pass `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` with writes (deferred). |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Who logged the session. |
| D | BookID | `ARKA_BOOK_X` | FK → ArkaLibraryDB. Which book was read. | "For unlinked page logs, contains a MaterialType string instead of a BookID (e.g. Academic, News / Journalism). Format is always distinct from ARKA_BOOK_X — backend resolves by checking for the ARKA_BOOK_ prefix."
| E | PagesDelta | integer | Pages read in this session (positive = progress). Zero or negative = correction entry; earns no points. |
| F | Source | `ArkaClubApp` or `10PagesADay` | Which app surface originated this log. Used for analytics. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Rows are never deleted or updated after insert. Corrections are new rows with negative/zero delta.
- MasterEngine reads all rows to compute TotalPages (Col P of MemberDB) and streak metrics.
- Streak and PLogger badge calculations use `Timestamp` (Col B) to determine ISO week membership.
---
 
## 3. ArkaLibraryDB
**Purpose:** The shared club book repository. One row per unique book title. Shared across all members.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | BookID | `ARKA_BOOK_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | Title | string | Formal title of the book. |
| C | Author | string | Primary author name. |
| D | Genre | string | Comma-separated genre tags. Free text. Used by Genre Explorer (canonical alias matching) and Genre Collector (synonym-collapsed). Canonical genres: Fiction, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Crime & Suspense, Non-Fiction, Self-Help, Philosophy, Psychology, Classics, Religious, Horror, Business, Poetry. |
| E | Pages | integer | Total page count of the physical/digital edition. Used for Fat Read badge evaluation. Must be > 0 for Fat Read to qualify. |
| F | AddedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Who first added the book. Used by Librarian badge count. |
| G | AddedDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | Date the book was added to the library. |
| H | LastModifiedDate | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | Full timestamp of the last metadata edit. |
| I | LastModifiedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Who last edited the book metadata. Subject to 30-day cooldown rule in MasterEngine. |
| J | CoverURL | Drive thumbnail URL or blank | `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=FILE_ID&sz=w400` Stored at w400; frontend requests smaller sizes by swapping `sz` param. |
| K | ISBN13 | 13-digit string or blank | Standard international book number. Used for auto-fill via ISBN lookup. |
| L | PublishedDate | year or date string | Year or date the book was first published. |
| M | Blurb | string | Short synopsis or description. Optional. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Col D genre tags must use the canonical genre list (or recognised aliases) for badge engine accuracy.
- Col E (Pages) is critical for Fat Read badge — books with 0 or blank pages never qualify.
- Col F (AddedBy) drives the Librarian badge. Must contain a valid `ARKA_MEMBER_X`.
---
 
## 4. MemberShelfDB
**Purpose:** Personal reading progress tracker. One row per member–book pairing. A member can have multiple rows for the same book (re-reads).
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | ShelfID | `ARKA_SHELF_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Owner of this shelf record. |
| C | BookID | `ARKA_BOOK_X` | FK → ArkaLibraryDB. The book being tracked. |
| D | Status | `To Read`, `Reading`, `Finished`, `Did Not Finish`, `Deleted` | Current reading status. Drives activity log entries and Club Points. Only `Finished` counts toward Book Milestone and Genre Explorer badges. `Deleted` is a soft-delete sentinel — the row is never physically removed. See constraints below. |
| E | Rating | `0`–`5` integer | Star rating. 0 = unrated. Displayed as stars in the UI. MasterEngine deduplicates — only the first rating entry per shelf record earns CP. |
| F | Review | string | Free-text review. Displayed on book detail page. MasterEngine deduplicates — only the first review entry per shelf record earns CP. |
| G | DateAdded | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | When the book was first put on shelf. |
| H | DateUpdated | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | When status or pages were last changed. |
| I | DateFinished | `dd-MMM-yyyy` or blank | Date member marked the book Finished. Used by `runYearEndBadgePass()` to count books finished per calendar year. |
| J | PagesRead | integer | Current page number reached. Updated on each page log. Cannot exceed the book's total pages by more than the `PAGE_DEVIATION_MULTIPLIER` tolerance. |
| K | LastModifiedOn | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | Full technical audit timestamp of last write. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- `Finished` status + `DateFinished` (Col I) is the source for yearly Bookworm of the Year counting.
- Genre Explorer uses `Finished` rows only — DNF does not contribute.
- Fat Read uses `Finished` rows only — book page count is looked up from ArkaLibraryDB Col E.
- `Deleted` rows are **never physically removed** from the sheet. They are invisible to the frontend (filtered in `getWave3Data()` before Wave 3 is sent) and ignored by all MasterEngine badge and stats passes which guard on `status === 'Finished'`. They remain readable by the backend `updateMemberShelf()` for the recycle strategy below.
- **Soft-delete:** When a member removes a book from their shelf, `deleteShelfRecord()` sets Col D to `Deleted`, Col E (Rating) to `0`, and Col F (Review) to `''` in a single atomic write. An `ARKA_ACTTYP_SHELFDELETE` activity is logged as an audit trail. MasterEngine Rule 8 uses this entry to generate CP reversal corrections for all direct shelf activities referencing that `ShelfID`.
- **Recycle on re-add:** If a member re-adds a previously deleted book, `updateMemberShelf()` finds the `Deleted` row via `deletedFallbackRowIndex` (Standard Search scans all statuses but skips Deleted rows for active-record logic) and overwrites it in place — resetting all fields to fresh values — rather than appending a new row. This keeps the DB lean. A new row is only created when no Deleted row exists for that member+book (genuinely new addition or deliberate re-read of an active Finished record).
- Cols E and F (Rating, Review) are always cleared to `0` / `''` when Status is set to `Deleted`. Stale rating/review values on a Deleted row would incorrectly surface in book detail avg ratings, review cards, and the rating sort.

## 5. ActivityLogDB
**Purpose:** The append-only social feed engine and financial ledger for Club Points. Every user action and every MasterEngine write produces a row here.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | ActivityID | `ARKA_ACT_X` | Primary key. Sequential. Never reuse. Generated by `lastRow + 1` pattern — safe only inside `LockService` or `logActivityBatch()`. |
| B | ActivityTypeID | `ARKA_ACTTYP_X` or `SYS_ACTTYP_X` | FK → ActivityTypeDB. Drives feed display, point validation, and audit rules. |
| C | ActivityDate | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the action occurred. GAS script timezone. |
| D | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Who performed or received the action. |
| E | Description | string | Contextual payload. Format varies by ActivityTypeID — see ActivityTypeDB reference table below. |
| F | Source | `ArkaClubApp vX`, `MasterSync Engine`, `10PagesADay` | Which system wrote this row. `MasterSync Engine` is a sentinel string — **never change**. Used by `findLastMasterSyncRowIndex()`. |
| G | CPAwarded | integer | Club Points awarded for this action. May be 0 or negative (corrections). For variable-point types, injected at log time. For fixed types, must match ActivityTypeDB multiplier (Rule 5). |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Rows are **never** deleted. Feed display logic uses `status` and activity type filtering for visibility.
- All writes outside MasterEngine must use `logActivityBatch()` (locked) to prevent ID collisions.
- `SYS_ACTTYP_*` rows are hidden from the home feed. `ARKA_ACTTYP_*` rows are visible unless explicitly filtered.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_MILESTONE_PAGES` and `ARKA_ACTTYP_MILESTONE_BOOKS` are **retired** — no longer written. Historical rows remain for audit continuity. Both types remain in `VARIABLE_POINT_TYPES` to prevent Rule 5 from re-validating them.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_PERSONAUPDATE` carries CP 0 and is written by PersonaPass, not the member. It is listed in `VARIABLE_POINT_TYPES` so MasterEngine Rule 5 never validates its CP against a fixed multiplier, and in `HIDDEN_TYPES` in `buildFeedAggregator` so it stays out of the home feed (silent deploy). Rows are an audit trail only — the "How You've Changed" persona timeline reads them directly.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_SHELFDELETE` is hidden from the home feed via `HIDDEN_TYPES` in `buildFeedAggregator`. It is an audit trail entry only — MasterEngine Rule 8 reads it on each nightly sync to identify soft-deleted shelves and generate CP reversal corrections for all related shelf activities. CP awarded is always 0.---
## 6. ActivityTypeDB
**Purpose:** The point economy rulebook. One row per activity type. Defines the CP multiplier and human-readable label for every action in the system.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | ActivityTypeID | `ARKA_ACTTYP_X` or `SYS_ACTTYP_X` | Primary key. `ARKA_` = user-visible; `SYS_` = system/hidden. |
| B | ActivityClubPoints | integer (can be 0 or negative) | CP multiplier. For variable-point types this is 0 or a placeholder — actual CP is injected at log time. |
| C | ActivityType | string | Human-readable name. e.g. `Finished a Book` |
| D | ActivityDescription | string | Internal description of when and how this type fires. |
| E | ActivityIntroDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | When this activity type was added to the system. |
| F | LogDescriptionFormat | string | Template for the `Description` field written to ActivityLogDB Col E. |
 
**Complete ActivityType Reference:**
 
| ActivityTypeID | CP | Human Name | Description | Intro | Col E Description Format |

| `ARKA_ACTTYP_MEMBERLEVELUP` | 0 | Levelled Up | Fires when a member crosses a level threshold. No CP — the level itself is the reward. Written immediately after the point sync that caused the level change. | 28-Feb-2026 | `From: <previousLevelName> \| To: <newLevelName>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_FEEDBACK` | 150 | Submitted Feedback | Fires when a member submits a bug report or feature suggestion via the in-app feedback form. | 6-Mar-2026 | `Type: <Bug/Feature> \| Area: <appSection>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_BOOKPOST` | 50 | Posted Book Discussion | Fires when a member publishes a discussion post (General Note, Quote I Loved, or Fan Cast) on a book's detail page. | 13-Mar-2026 | `<BookPostID>\|<BookID>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_BADGEAWARD` | 0* | Badge Awarded | Fires when an admin manually awards a badge to a member. `CPAwarded` is set at log time to the badge's own point value from BadgeDB — the multiplier of 0 here is a placeholder only. | 14-Mar-2026 | `<AwardID>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_BADGEREVOKE` | 0* | Badge Revoked | Fires when an admin revokes a badge from a member. `CPAwarded` is set at log time to the negative of the original badge point value, reversing the award. | 14-Mar-2026 | `<AwardID>` |

| `ARKA_ACTTYP_PERSONAUPDATE` | 0 | Reading Personality Shift | Fires from the nightly PersonaPass when a member's verdict on a persona axis changes (including first-time resolution from a gated/forming state). One row per changed axis. **Hidden from home feed** (`HIDDEN_TYPES`). Sole history source for the "How You've Changed" persona timeline. | 2-Jun-2026 | `Axis: <axisName> \| <oldSide> → <newSide> \| Archetype: <oldArchetype> → <newArchetype>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_SHAREPROGRESS` | 15 | Shared Progress | Fires when a member shares their reading progress to an external channel (e.g. WhatsApp). One CP-earning share per day enforced by MasterEngine audit. | 7-Jun-2026 | `Channel: <channelName> \| Shared: <weeklyPulse/badge/streak>` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_CLUBPOINTS_UPDATE` | 0 | System: Sync Club Points | Written by MasterEngine after recalculating a member's true point total and syncing it to MemberDB. **Hidden from feed.** | 22-Feb-2026 | `Delta: <+/- points> synced to profile` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_CLUBPOINTS_ADD` | 0 | System: Add Bonus Points | Written when an admin manually credits bonus points to a member's account outside the normal activity flow. | 22-Feb-2026 | `Points: <delta> \| Reason: <reasonText>` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_CLUBPOINTS_CORRECTION` | 0 | System: Points Correction | Negative correction written by MasterEngine when an audit rule violation is detected (e.g. duplicate rating, same-day profile update spam). `CPAwarded` always negative. | 12-Mar-2026 | `Reason: <ruleViolated> \| Offsetting: <ActivityID>` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_TOTALPAGES_UPDATE` | 0 | System: Sync Total Pages | Written by MasterEngine after syncing a member's cumulative page count to MemberDB. **Hidden from feed.** | 7-Mar-2026 | `Delta: <+/- pages> synced to profile` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_TOTALBOOKS_UPDATE` | 0 | System: Sync Total Books | Written by MasterEngine after syncing a member's cumulative finished-book count to MemberDB. **Hidden from feed.** | 7-Mar-2026 | `Delta: <+/- books> synced to profile` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_PAGEREAD` | 0* | System: Add Pages | Admin or system mechanism to credit pages and points directly (e.g. data imports, manual corrections). `CPAwarded` written directly to the log — multiplier not used. | 7-Mar-2026 | `Reason: <reasonText> \| Points Awarded: <cpAwarded>` |
| `SYS_ACTTYP_BADGEAWARD` | 0 | System: Auto-Award Badge | **RETIRED.** Legacy type — no longer written. Kept in `VARIABLE_POINT_TYPES` for audit safety. Historical rows remain valid. | 22-Feb-2026 | `<BadgeID>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_MILESTONE_PAGES` | 0 | Page Milestone Reached | **RETIRED.** Legacy milestone type replaced by badge system. Historical rows intact. | 7-Mar-2026 | `<thresholdPages>` |
| `ARKA_ACTTYP_MILESTONE_BOOKS` | 0 | Book Milestone Reached | **RETIRED.** Legacy milestone type replaced by badge system. Historical rows intact. | 7-Mar-2026 | `<thresholdBooks>` |
 
*Variable CP — actual value injected at log time; the ActivityTypeDB multiplier of 0 is not used for point calculation.
 
**Key constraints:**
- All writes outside MasterEngine must use `logActivityBatch()` (locked) to prevent ID collisions.
- `SYS_ACTTYP_*` rows and types marked **Hidden from home feed** are filtered in `buildFeedAggregator` via the `HIDDEN_TYPES` set.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_PERSONAUPDATE` is listed in both `VARIABLE_POINT_TYPES` (so Rule 5 never validates its CP against a fixed multiplier) and `HIDDEN_TYPES` (silent deploy — feed-invisible). Written by PersonaPass only, never by the member frontend.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_SHELFDELETE` is **Hidden from home feed.** MasterEngine Rule 8 reads it on each nightly sync to identify soft-deleted shelves and generate CP reversal corrections for all related shelf activities. CP awarded is always 0.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_WHATSAPP` is defined but **not yet wired** — no in-app share button exists. No rows will be written until the button is built.
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_SHAREPROGRESS` enforces one CP-earning share per day via MasterEngine audit (same pattern as `ARKA_ACTTYP_PROFILEUPDATE`).
- `ARKA_ACTTYP_BADGEREVOKE` writes a negative `CPAwarded` equal to the original badge point value. MasterEngine Rule logic should treat this the same as `SYS_ACTTYP_CLUBPOINTS_CORRECTION` for point reconciliation.
- Retired types (`SYS_ACTTYP_BADGEAWARD`, `ARKA_ACTTYP_MILESTONE_PAGES`, `ARKA_ACTTYP_MILESTONE_BOOKS`) remain in `VARIABLE_POINT_TYPES` to prevent Rule 5 from re-validating historical rows. No new rows are ever written for these types.

## 7. FeedbackDB
**Purpose:** Internal support log. Every bug report and feature request submitted via the in-app feedback form. Admin-reviewed only, not visible to members.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | Timestamp | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the feedback was submitted. No primary key — row order is the identifier. |
| B | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Who submitted the feedback. |
| C | MemberName | string | DisplayName at submission time. Denormalised for quick admin reference. |
| D | AppSource | string | App version at submission time. e.g. `v49` |
| E | Category | `Bug`, `Feature` | Type of submission. |
| F | Section | string | App area where the issue or idea applies. e.g. `Home Feed`, `Library`, `Badge Gallery` |
| G | Description | string | The full feedback text. |
| H | Status | `Open`, `In Progress`, `Resolved` | Admin-managed workflow status. Updated manually in the sheet. |
 
---
 
## 8. ClubPointLevelDB
**Purpose:** The progression engine. Defines the CP thresholds and names for all 100 member levels. Read-only at runtime — no writes during app operation.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | LevelNum | integer `1`–`100` | Sequential rank. |
| B | MaxClubPoints | integer | Upper CP boundary for this level. Once a member's TotalClubPoints exceeds this value they advance to the next level. |
| C | LevelName | string | Display title. e.g. `Page Turner I`, `Bookworm V`, `Oracle X` |
 
**Level tiers:** Page Turner (1–10) → Bookworm (11–20) → Scholar (21–30) → Bibliophile (31–40) → Scribe (41–50) → Sage (51–60) → Luminary (61–70) → Maven (71–80) → Virtuoso (81–90) → Oracle (91–100). Max level CP: 1,110,000.
 
---
 
## 9. BookPostDB
**Purpose:** Community discussions. Members post notes, quotes, and fan casts on individual book pages.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | BookPostID | `ARKA_BOOKPOST_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | BookID | `ARKA_BOOK_X` | FK → ArkaLibraryDB. The book being discussed. |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Author of the post. |
| D | Timestamp | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the post was published. |
| E | PostType | `General Note`, `Quote I Loved`, `Fan Cast` | Category driving display icon and layout. |
| F | Content | string | Full post text. Line breaks preserved. |
| G | Status | `Active`, `Deleted` | Soft delete — `Deleted` rows hidden from display but retained for audit. |
| H | LikeCount | integer | Running total of likes. Updated in-place when a member likes the post. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Max 3 CP-earning posts per member per calendar day (Rule 7 in MasterEngine). Posts beyond the cap are still saved and visible — only the CP is reversed.
---
 
## 10. BadgeDB
**Purpose:** The badge catalogue. One row per badge definition. Includes the 225 auto-awarded system badges (milestones, streaks, genres etc.) and any admin-created special badges.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | BadgeID | `ARKA_BADGE_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | Caption | string | Short display name. e.g. `Page Voyager`, `Fantasy Fan` |
| C | Description | string | Full description of what the badge represents and how to earn it. |
| D | ImgUrl | Drive thumbnail URL or blank | `https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=FILE_ID&sz=w400` — Frontend swaps `sz` for size variants. Blank until image uploaded via admin panel. |
| E | BadgePoints | integer | Club Points awarded when this badge is earned. Injected as `CPAwarded` in the `ARKA_ACTTYP_BADGEAWARD` log entry. |
| F | BadgeCategory | see values below | Gallery section grouping and MasterEngine routing key. |
| G | BadgeTier | integer `0`–`N` | Ordering within a replacing series. `1` = lowest tier, highest integer = max tier. `0` for non-tiered badges (YEARLY, SPECIAL). |
| H | BadgeMeta | string or blank | Auxiliary context: genre name for GENRE_EXPLORER (e.g. `Fantasy`), `YYYY\|TYPE_CODE` for YEARLY (e.g. `2025\|CRITIC_OF_YEAR`), blank for all others. |
 
**BadgeCategory values:**
 
| Category | Description | Display | Tiers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PAGE_MILESTONE` | Lifetime pages crossed a threshold | Replacing | 10 tiers |
| `BOOK_MILESTONE` | Lifetime books finished crossed a threshold | Replacing | 10 tiers |
| `STREAK_MILESTONE` | All-time best consecutive ISO-week reading streak | Replacing | 9 tiers |
| `PLOGGER` | Total unique ISO weeks with at least one page log | Replacing | 9 tiers |
| `REVIEW_MILESTONE` | Lifetime reviews written crossed a threshold | Replacing | 10 tiers |
| `FAT_READ` | Finished a single book of N+ pages | Replacing | 8 tiers |
| `GENRE_EXPLORER` | Finished N books in a specific canonical genre | Replacing per genre | 10 tiers × 13 genres |
| `GENRE_COLLECTOR` | Unique normalised genre strings across all finished books | Replacing | 8 tiers |
| `ANNIVERSARY` | Years as an active Arka Club member | Replacing | 11 tiers |
| `SOCIAL_BUTTERFLY` | Events attended | Replacing | 8 tiers |
| `LIBRARIAN` | Books added to the library | Replacing | 7 tiers |
| `YEARLY` | Annual award (Critic of the Year, Bookworm, etc.) | All earned shown; current year targets shown greyed | 0 (non-tiered) |
| `SPECIAL` | Admin-created one-off badges | Earned only, no teasers | 0 |
 
**Replacing display rule:** Gallery and badge strip show only the highest-tier Active award per series. All tiers are permanently stored in BadgeAwardDB — the filter is display-only and never revokes records.
 
---
 
## 11. BadgeAwardDB
**Purpose:** Immutable ledger of every badge award and revocation. One row per award event.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | AwardID | `ARKA_AWARD_X` | Primary key. Sequential. Never reuse. |
| B | BadgeID | `ARKA_BADGE_X` | FK → BadgeDB. Which badge was awarded. |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Who received the badge. |
| D | AwardedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` or `MasterEngine` | Who or what awarded the badge. `MasterEngine` (literal string) = auto-awarded by system. Any `ARKA_MEMBER_X` = admin-awarded manually. |
| E | AwardedDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | Date of the award. |
| F | Status | `Active`, `Revoked` | `Active` = currently held. `Revoked` = admin-revoked; CP is reversed via `ARKA_ACTTYP_BADGEREVOKE` activity entry. Records are never deleted. |
| G | Notes | string or blank | Optional admin note on manual awards. For revocations: reason and revoking admin ID written here. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Duplicate guard: `awardBadgeToMember()` and `autoAwardBadge_()` both check for an existing `Active` row with the same `BadgeID` + `MemberID` before inserting.
- When MasterEngine re-awards a previously revoked badge it creates a **new row** — it does not flip the status of the old row.
- `MemberDB.Celebration` (Col N) is a notification signal written by MasterEngine. It is not a source of truth — BadgeAwardDB remains authoritative for all badge ownership queries.
---
 
## 12. EventDB
**Purpose:** Club event calendar. One row per event — meetings, book buddy reads, social events, and more.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | EventID | `ARKA_EVENT_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | EventType | `Meeting-Virtual`, `Meeting-F2F`, `BookBuddyRead`, `Social`, `Other` | Drives UI icon and badge colour. Used in event-type CP map for attendance awards. |
| C | Title | string | Display name of the event. |
| D | Description | string | Full event details. Can be long. |
| E | HostMemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` or blank | Optional event host. When confirmed as host, fires `ARKA_ACTTYP_EVENTHOSTED` alongside `ARKA_ACTTYP_EVENTATTENDED`. |
| F | StartDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | Event start date. |
| G | StartTime | `HH:mm` | 24-hour format. |
| H | EndDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | Event end date. Can equal StartDate for single-day events. |
| I | EndTime | `HH:mm` | 24-hour format. |
| J | MeetingLink | URL or blank | Zoom/Meet/Teams link for virtual events. |
| K | AssetsJson | JSON string or blank | Consolidated media attachments. Format: `[{"type":"Photo","title":"...","link":"..."}]` No separate assets sheet. |
| L | Status | `Active`, `Cancelled`, `Completed` | `Cancelled` fires `ARKA_ACTTYP_EVENTCANCELLED`. `Completed` set by admin after event. |
 
---
 
## 13. EventRSVPDB
**Purpose:** RSVP and attendance ledger. One row per member per event. Created when a member RSVPs or when an admin pre-adds them.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | RSVPId | `ARKA_RSVP_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | EventID | `ARKA_EVENT_X` | FK → EventDB. Which event this RSVP is for. |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Which member this row belongs to. |
| D | RSVPStatus | `Yes`, `No`, `Maybe`, `Invited` | Member's own response. `Invited` = pre-added by admin/host; member has not yet responded. `Yes`/`Maybe` fire `ARKA_ACTTYP_EVENTRSVP` and earn CP. `No` earns no CP. |
| E | RSVPDate | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | Timestamp of RSVP or when the invitation row was created. |
| F | AttendanceConfirmed | `Yes`, `No`, blank | Post-event admin confirmation of physical/virtual attendance. Blank until admin marks it. |
| G | ConfirmedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` or blank | Which admin confirmed the attendance. |
| H | ConfirmedOn | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` or blank | When attendance was confirmed. Fires `ARKA_ACTTYP_EVENTATTENDED` (and `ARKA_ACTTYP_EVENTHOSTED` if member is the host). |
| I | AddedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Who created this RSVP row. Self = member RSVPed themselves. Otherwise = admin or host pre-added them. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- `AttendanceConfirmed = Yes` is the trigger for Social Butterfly badge count in MasterEngine.
- One row per member–event pair. Updating an existing RSVP changes Col D in-place; a new row is not created.
---
 
## 14. ChallengeDB
**Purpose:** Club challenge definitions. One row per challenge edition. Challenges may have multiple enrollments (ChallengeEnrollmentDB).
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | ChallengeID | `ARKA_CHAL_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | ChallengeType | `HABIT_STREAK`, `BINGO_GRID`, etc. | Type code. Drives the UI renderer and progress tracking logic for each challenge variant. |
| C | Title | string | Display name. e.g. `Book Bingo 2026` |
| D | Description | string | What members need to do to complete or win the challenge. |
| E | StartDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | Challenge opens for enrollment. |
| F | EndDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` or blank | Challenge closes. Blank = open-ended. |
| G | GoalValue | integer | Primary numeric target. e.g. `24` for a 24-book challenge. |
| H | GoalUnit | `pages`, `books`, `letters`, `countries`, etc. | Unit of the goal metric. Drives progress bar label. |
| I | GoalConfigJson | JSON string or blank | Type-specific configuration. e.g. Bingo grid square definitions. Format varies by ChallengeType. |
| J | Status | `Active`, `Upcoming`, `Completed`, `Archived` | Drives visibility in Challenges tab. `Active` = enrollable and in progress. |
| K | CompetitionMode | `NONE`, `INDIVIDUAL`, `SHARED`, `TEAM` | Controls leaderboard and scoring behaviour. `NONE` = personal challenge, no leaderboard. `INDIVIDUAL` = ranked per-member leaderboard. `SHARED` = whole club works toward a common goal with individual contribution tracking. `TEAM` = subgroups compete (reserved, not yet implemented). Legacy `TRUE`/`FALSE` values are accepted and mapped to `INDIVIDUAL`/`NONE` respectively. |
| L | SeriesTag | string or blank | Groups multiple editions of the same challenge. e.g. `BOOK_BINGO` groups all annual Bingo editions. |
| M | IsPinned | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | If TRUE, challenge is pinned to the top of the Challenges list. |
| N | CreatedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Who created the challenge. Admin only. |
| O | CreatedOn | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the challenge was created. |
 
---
 
## 15. ChallengeEnrollmentDB
**Purpose:** Member participation ledger for challenges. One row per member–challenge pairing.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | EnrollmentID | `ARKA_ENRL_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | ChallengeID | `ARKA_CHAL_X` | FK → ChallengeDB. Which challenge. |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Which member. |
| D | EnrolledOn | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the member enrolled. Fires `ARKA_ACTTYP_CHALLENGE_ENROLL`. |
| E | EnrollmentStatus | `Active`, `Winner`, `Finisher`, `Dropped` | Current participation status. `Winner` and `Finisher` fire their respective activity log entries and award CP. `Dropped` fires `ARKA_ACTTYP_CHALLENGE_DROP` (no CP). |
| F | CurrentProgressValue | integer | Quick-read integer snapshot of current progress. e.g. books completed so far. Updated alongside Col G. |
| G | ProgressStateJson | JSON string | Full serialised progress state. Format varies by ChallengeType. e.g. Bingo grid completion map. Read and written by the challenge progress engine. |
| H | LastProgressUpdate | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | Timestamp of most recent progress write. |
| I | CompletedOn | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` or blank | When status transitioned to Winner or Finisher. |
 
---
 
## 16. AnnouncementDB
**Purpose:** Club-wide announcements shown in the home feed banner. Admin-managed.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | AnnouncementID | `ARKA_ANN_X` | Primary key. Sequential. |
| B | Title | string | Short headline. Displayed as the banner title. |
| C | Body | string | Full announcement text. Supports line breaks. |
| D | IsPinned | `TRUE`/`FALSE` | If TRUE, pins the announcement to the top of the home feed banner. |
| E | ExpiryDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` or blank | After this date the announcement stops displaying. Blank = no expiry. |
| F | Status | `Active`, `Archived` | `Active` = visible. `Archived` = hidden. The backend only sends `Active` rows to the frontend. |
| G | CreatedBy | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Which admin created the announcement. |
| H | CreatedOn | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the announcement was published. Fires `ARKA_ACTTYP_ANNOUNCEMENTPOSTED` (no CP, hidden from feed). |
| J | DismissedBy | comma-separated `ARKA_MEMBER_X` or blank | Members who have permanently dismissed this announcement. Written by `dismissAnnouncementPermanently()`. Never set for pinned announcements — they cannot be dismissed. |
 
---
 
## 17. AppLoadTimingDB
**Purpose:** Performance monitoring. Records app load times silently on each member session open. Internal use only — not visible to members.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` or `UNKNOWN` | Who loaded the app. `UNKNOWN` if session was unresolvable. |
| B | Timestamp | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the load completed. |
| C | AppVersion | string | App version at time of load. e.g. `v49` |
| D | BigGulpMs | integer | Milliseconds from T0 to Big Gulp (Wave 1 data fetch) success handler firing. Includes network round-trip + GAS execution time. |
| E | RenderMs | integer | Milliseconds from Big Gulp complete to first full render. Client-side only. |
| F | TotalMs | integer | Total perceived load time (D + E). The primary performance KPI. |
 
**Key notes:**
- All writes via `logAppLoadTime()` which is fire-and-forget — failures are swallowed silently.
- No primary key — row order is the only identifier. Do not sort or reorder this sheet.
- Use this data to identify regressions after major deployments.
---
## 18. PersonaProfileDB
**Purpose:** Denormalized, pre-computed Reading Personality snapshot. **One row per member**, rewritten in full by the nightly PersonaPass (`runArkaPersonaPass`). This is a display cache, **not** a ledger — it lets any member's profile card and full personality panel render from a single row without crunching another member's PageLogDB client-side (cross-member page logs are never loaded into the app). BadgeAwardDB remains the source of truth for *which* personas are held; this table is the display + insight layer. The "How You've Changed" timeline is **not** stored here — it is read from `ARKA_ACTTYP_PERSONAUPDATE` rows in ActivityLogDB.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | Primary key. FK → MemberDB. One row per member, upserted by PersonaPass. Keyed on member — not a sequential autoincrement. |
| B | ArchetypeKey | `ARKA_PERSONA_ARCH_X` or blank | Stable key of the synthesized headline type (e.g. `ARKA_PERSONA_ARCH_MIDNIGHTSCHOLAR`). Blank if too few axes resolved to name an archetype. |
| C | ArchetypeName | string | Denormalized display name (`The Midnight Scholar`). Stored flat so the profile card needs no second lookup. |
| D | ArchetypeEmoji | string | Display glyph (`🌙`). Denormalized for the card header. |
| E | ArchetypeTagline | string | The italic one-liner under the archetype name. |
| F | AxisVerdicts | JSON string | Full spectrum. Array of `{ axis, side, badgeID, position, gated, note }`. `position` 0–100 drives the slider marker; `gated:true` = "still forming" — render the nudge instead of a verdict. Single source for the whole spectrum section. JSON (not flat columns) so new axes need no schema migration. |
| G | Insights | JSON string | "Things you didn't know" payload. Array of `{ kind, glyph, stat, caption, accent }`. Pre-computed because cross-member PageLog is not available client-side. |
| H | BlindSpot | JSON string or blank | The single highlighted dark-card insight: `{ eyebrow, text }`. Separate from G so PersonaPass can null it without disturbing the strip. |
| I | RaritySummary | JSON string | `{ archetypeShare: "3/47", axisRarities: { rhythm: "1/6", … } }`. Computed club-wide in the same pass and stored per member to avoid a club-wide recount on every profile open. |
| J | ComputedDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | When PersonaPass last wrote this row. Drives the "as of …" label and lets the engine skip members whose underlying data fingerprint is unchanged. |
| K | EngineVersion | string | e.g. `PersonaEngine v1`. Lets a logic change force-recompute rows written by an older ruleset. |
| L | Status | `Active`, `Suppressed` | `Active` = render normally. `Suppressed` = member opted out of public personality display; own profile still shows it, others' do not. Rows never deleted. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Upsert, not append: PersonaPass overwrites the existing row for a member by MemberID. There is at most one row per member.
- Not the timeline source: this table holds only the *current* snapshot. Historical drift lives in `ARKA_ACTTYP_PERSONAUPDATE` rows.
- Personas carry **0 AP** by design — re-evaluable badges must never inflate the points economy. Awarding/superseding happens in BadgeAwardDB; this table only mirrors the resolved state for display.
## 19. ReadingNotesDB
**Purpose:** Immutable reading diary ledger. One row per saved note. Stores freeform session notes written during page logging. Source of truth for the future reading diary UI. Never mutated after insert — corrections are new rows.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | NoteID | `ARKA_NOTE_X` | Primary key. Sequential integer suffix. Never reuse a deleted ID. |
| B | Timestamp | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When the note was saved. Stored in GAS script timezone (+0100). |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB. Who wrote the note. |
| D | PlogID | `ARKA_PLOG_X` or blank | FK → PageLogDB. The page log session this note was written alongside. Resolves to BookID or MaterialType via PageLogDB Col D of that row. Blank is reserved for future standalone diary entries not tied to a page log event. |
| E | NoteText | string, max 10,000 chars | Freeform diary entry. Never empty — rows with blank NoteText are never written. Client enforces 10,000-char limit with a live counter. |
| F | Source | `QuickLog` \| `ProgressLog` | Which modal surface originated the note. `QuickLog` = unlinked page logger (Me tab). `ProgressLog` = book reading progress logger. Used for analytics on member logging habits. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Rows are never deleted or updated after insert. This is an append-only diary ledger.
- A row is only written when `NoteText.trim().length > 0`. The backend `appendReadingNote()` function enforces this guard before every write.
- Col D (PlogID) is always populated for `QuickLog` and `ProgressLog` sources — the PLOG row is created first in the same function call, and its ID is passed directly to the note writer. A valid FK is guaranteed when the field is non-blank.
- Never part of the Big Gulp initial load. Fetched lazily per member via `getMemberNotes(memberId)` only when the diary view is opened.
- MasterEngine does not read or write this table. It is owned entirely by the frontend logging flow.

## Email BackEnd Spreadsheet
**Spreadsheet ID:** `1s5h8T6PGPTOBs_RKJNRJjRCZm8igWJzmniLRoW7BFJA`
**Owner:** Club admin (owner-run GAS project only — never accessed by the member-facing app)
**Purpose:** All outbound email infrastructure. Kept separate from the main spreadsheet so email queue state never touches data the member app reads, and so `MailApp` OAuth scope is permanently isolated to the BackEndEngine project.
 
---
 
## 20. EmailQueueDB
**Purpose:** Nightly job queue for outbound member emails. MasterEngine's `_syncEmailQueue_()` appends PENDING rows each night after evaluating member eligibility. ArkaEmailPass reads PENDING rows at 00:30, sends via `MailApp`, and updates each row to SENT or FAILED. EmailSentLogDB is the permanent audit trail — EmailQueueDB rows may be periodically purged after 90 days.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | QueueID | `ARKA_EMAILQ_X` | Primary key. Sequential integer suffix. Written by MasterEngine. |
| B | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB (main spreadsheet). Who this email is addressed to. |
| C | EmailAddress | `user@gmail.com` | Primary email only (first value from MemberDB Col B, before any comma). Copied at queue-write time so ArkaEmailPass needs no main-sheet read. |
| D | DisplayName | string | Member display name at queue-write time. Used for email personalisation. |
| E | EmailType | `REENGAGEMENT_7D` / `REENGAGEMENT_14D` / `REENGAGEMENT_30D` / `STREAK_RISK` / `CHALLENGE_DEADLINE` / `FINISH_NUDGE` | Determines which email template ArkaEmailPass uses. Priority order enforced by MasterEngine: STREAK_RISK > CHALLENGE_DEADLINE > FINISH_NUDGE > REENGAGEMENT_30D > REENGAGEMENT_14D > REENGAGEMENT_7D. At most one row per member per night. |
| F | PayloadJSON | JSON string | All personalisation data pre-baked by MasterEngine. Shape: `{ displayName, archetype, daysSinceLastLog, daysSinceAccess, currentBookTitle, currentBookAuthor, recentWeekCount, challengeTitle, challengeType, challengeDaysLeft, challengeCurrent, challengeGoal, finishBookTitle, finishBookAuthor, finishPagesLeft, clubHighlights: [{ memberDisplayName }] }`. ArkaEmailPass reads no main-sheet data — everything needed for composition is here. |
| G | ScheduledDate | `dd-MMM-yyyy` | The date MasterEngine wrote this row (i.e. tonight's date). |
| H | Status | `PENDING` / `SENT` / `FAILED` / `SUPPRESSED` | Lifecycle state. ArkaEmailPass updates this in-place immediately after each send attempt — prevents double-sends if the pass crashes mid-loop and restarts. `SUPPRESSED` = valid row but skipped (e.g. unknown EmailType). |
| I | SentAt | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` or blank | Timestamp written by ArkaEmailPass on successful send. Blank until sent. |
| J | TrackingToken | `ARKA_ET_XXXXXXXX` | Unique 8-char alphanumeric token appended to the email deep-link URL (`?eid=`). When the member opens the app via the link, `logEmailClick()` logs `ARKA_ACTTYP_EMAIL_CLICK` with this token as the description. MasterEngine matches it back here to populate ClickedAt. |
| K | ClickedAt | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` or blank | Back-filled nightly by MasterEngine's `_syncEmailQueue_()` when a matching `ARKA_ACTTYP_EMAIL_CLICK` activity is found in ActivityLogDB. Blank = email not yet clicked or token not yet matched. |
| L | CampaignID | string | Analytics identifier. Format: `emailtype_yyyyMMdd` e.g. `streak-risk_20260613`. Used to slice click rates and open rates by campaign in the sheet. |
| M | CreatedAt | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` | When MasterEngine wrote this row. Used by the frequency cap check — MasterEngine skips members whose most recent PENDING or SENT row was created within `EMAIL_FREQ_CAP_DAYS` days. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- One row per member per night maximum. Priority logic in `_syncEmailQueue_()` enforces this.
- FAILED rows do not count toward the frequency cap — a failed send should not block a retry the following night.
- Status is updated in-place (not appended) by ArkaEmailPass so crash recovery never re-sends a SENT email.
- Rows older than 90 days may be purged periodically. EmailSentLogDB is the permanent record.
- Never written by the member-facing app. Read-only from MasterEngine (via BackEndEngine project).
---
 
## 21. EmailSentLogDB
**Purpose:** Permanent, append-only audit log of every email send attempt. Never purged. Provides the historical record for deliverability analysis, click-rate reporting, and member communication history. ArkaEmailPass appends one row per send attempt (success or failure) after the queue loop completes.
 
| Col | Field | ID Format / Values | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------------------|-------|
| A | LogID | `ARKA_EMAILLOG_X` | Primary key. Sequential integer suffix. |
| B | QueueID | `ARKA_EMAILQ_X` | FK → EmailQueueDB. The queue row this log entry corresponds to. |
| C | MemberID | `ARKA_MEMBER_X` | FK → MemberDB (main spreadsheet). |
| D | EmailAddress | `user@gmail.com` | Recipient address at send time. |
| E | EmailType | string | Copied from EmailQueueDB Col E at send time. |
| F | Subject | string | Actual subject line sent. Useful for A/B subject line analysis in future. |
| G | SentAt | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` or blank | Timestamp of the `MailApp.sendEmail()` call. Blank if FAILED before send. |
| H | Status | `SENT` / `FAILED` | Outcome of the send attempt. |
| I | ErrorMessage | string or blank | `MailApp` error message if Status = FAILED. Blank if SENT. |
| J | TrackingToken | `ARKA_ET_XXXXXXXX` | Copied from EmailQueueDB Col J. Useful for cross-referencing click events directly in this log. |
| K | ClickedAt | `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss Z` or blank | Reserved for future back-fill. Currently back-filled only in EmailQueueDB Col K. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Rows are never deleted or updated after insert. Append-only permanent record.
- All writes via `runArkaEmailPass()` batch-append after the send loop — never row-by-row writes.
- FAILED rows must be logged here even when no email was sent — they are the audit trail for deliverability issues.
---
 
## 22. BackEndConfigDB
**Purpose:** Runtime configuration for the Email BackEnd system. All thresholds and kill switches are read here by MasterEngine (`_syncEmailQueue_()`) and ArkaEmailPass (`_loadEmailConfig_()`). Change values directly in the sheet — no code deployment needed.
 
| Col | Field | Values | Notes |

| A | ConfigKey | string | Unique configuration key. Case-sensitive. Must match exactly the string referenced in code. |
| B | ConfigValue | string / boolean / number | Value read at runtime. Booleans stored as `true`/`false` (not `TRUE`/`FALSE`). Numbers stored as plain integers. |
| C | Notes | string | Human-readable explanation. Not read by code. |
 
**Seed rows (do not delete):**
 
| ConfigKey | Default Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_QUEUE_ENABLED` | `true` | MasterEngine kill switch. Set `false` to stop writing queue rows without changing code. |
| `EMAILPASS_ENABLED` | `true` | ArkaEmailPass kill switch. Set `false` to stop all sends. |
| `EMAIL_SENDER_NAME` | `Arka Readers Club` | Display name in Gmail From field. |
| `EMAIL_FREQ_CAP_DAYS` | `7` | Minimum days between any two emails to the same member. |
| `REENGAGEMENT_7D_ENABLED` | `true` | 7–13 day dormancy emails. |
| `REENGAGEMENT_14D_ENABLED` | `true` | 14–29 day dormancy emails. |
| `REENGAGEMENT_30D_ENABLED` | `true` | 30+ day dormancy emails. |
| `STREAK_RISK_ENABLED` | `true` | Streak-at-risk emails. |
| `STREAK_RISK_MIN_STREAK_WEEKS` | `3` | Minimum recent active weeks to consider a streak at risk. |
| `STREAK_RISK_MIN_DAYS_SINCE_LOG` | `5` | Days without a page log before streak risk fires. |
| `CHALLENGE_DEADLINE_ENABLED` | `true` | Challenge deadline emails. |
| `CHALLENGE_DEADLINE_MAX_DAYS_LEFT` | `3` | Days remaining on a challenge to trigger the email. |
| `FINISH_NUDGE_ENABLED` | `true` | Finish-line nudge emails. |
| `FINISH_NUDGE_MAX_PAGES_LEFT` | `50` | Pages remaining in a Reading-shelf book to trigger the nudge. |
| `FINISH_NUDGE_MIN_DAYS_SINCE_LOG` | `4` | Days without a page log before the finish nudge fires. |
 
**Key constraints:**
- Config is loaded fresh on every ArkaEmailPass run — changes take effect the same night.
- Kill switches are checked by both MasterEngine (stops queue writes) and ArkaEmailPass (stops sends). Setting either to `false` is sufficient to halt the pipeline for that night.
- There is also a Script Property kill switch (`EMAILPASS_ENABLED = 'false'`) in ArkaEmailPass's GAS project that takes priority over this sheet and requires no spreadsheet read. Use the Script Property for an immediate emergency stop.
